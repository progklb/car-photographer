# Assetto Corsa

All content contained herein is extracted from Assetto Corsa game files.

The naming and structure of the files and directories have been kept the same as the original files for reference. Where it makes sense however, some files have been moved up the hierarchy so that they can be shared between models to prevent duplication, and unnecessary files deleted. Some files (textures) have also been modified as necessary to make them Unity-compatible.

Note that all content is the property of the creators of Assetto Corsa: Kunos Simulazioni and 505 Games.
